# Note on android/: in managed Expo projects, you usually want to ignore the android/ directory.
# If you run `npx expo run:android`, it will be generated.
# If you eject (prebuild), you might want to commit it. 
# Given the user context "why not found expo", this seems like a managed workflow or close to it, 
# but they did run `expo run:android` which generates it. 
# Safe default for managed flow often ignores it, but if they prebuilt, they might want it.
# However, standard practice for many Expo users is to gitignore it and regenerate.
# I will ignore it as per plan, but if the user has custom native code, this might need adjustment.
# The user approved "Ignore: ... android/ (build folders)".
